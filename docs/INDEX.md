# Eravat 2.0 — Documentation Index

Welcome to the Eravat project docs. Every session's work is recorded here so context is never lost between AI chat sessions.

## 📖 How to Use These Docs

**At the start of every new session:**
1. Read [`README.md`](./README.md) — full project architecture
2. Read the latest session log in [`sessions/`](./sessions/) — what was last worked on

**At the end of every session:**
- The AI agent should create a new file in `sessions/` with date + topic as the filename.
